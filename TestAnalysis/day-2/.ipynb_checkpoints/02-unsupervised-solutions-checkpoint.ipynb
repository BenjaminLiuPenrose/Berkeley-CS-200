It uses the co-occurrence of words within documents, compared to their distribution across documents, to uncover these abstract themes.

    "### TF-IDF scores\n",
    "\n",
    "How to find distinctive words in a corpus is a long-standing question in text analysis. Today, we'll learn one simple approach to this: TF-IDF. The idea behind words scores is to weight words not just by their frequency, but by their frequency in one document compared to their distribution across all documents. Words that are frequent, but are also used in every single document, will not be distinguising. We want to identify words that are unevenly distributed across the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular ways to weight words (beyond frequency counts) is `tf-idf score`. By offsetting the frequency of a word by its document frequency (the number of documents in which it appears) will in theory filter out common terms such as 'the', 'of', and 'and'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the inverse document frequency is calculated as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "number_of_documents / number_documents_with_term\n",
    "\n",
    "so:\n",
    "\n",
    "tfidf_word1 = word1_frequency_document1 * (number_of_documents / number_document_with_word1)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can, and often should, normalize the numerator: \n",
    "\n",
    "tfidf_word1 = (word1_frequency_document1 / word_count_document1) * (number_of_documents / number_document_with_word1)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate this manually, but scikit-learn has a built-in function to do so. This function also uses log frequencies, so the numbers will not correspond excactly to the calculations above. We'll use the [scikit-learn calculation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html), but a challenge for you: use Pandas to calculate this manually.

    "First, a bit of theory. LDA is a generative model - a model over the entire data generating process - in which a document is a mixture of topics and topics are probability distributions over tokens in the vocabulary. The (normalized) frequency of word $j$ in document $i$ can be written as:\n",
    "$q_{ij} = v_{i1}*\\theta_{1j} + v_{i2}*\\theta_{2j} + ... + v_{iK}*\\theta_{Kj}$\n",
    "where K is the total number of topics, $\\theta_{kj}$ is the probability that word $j$ shows up in topic $k$ and $v_{ik}$ is the weight assigned to topic $k$ in document $i$. The model treats $v$ and $\\theta$ as generated from Dirichlet-distributed priors and can be estimated through Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we will be using a different dataset for this technique. The music reviews in the above dataset are often short, one word or one sentence reviews. Topic modeling is not really appropriate for texts that are this short. Instead, we want texts that are longer and are composed of multiple topics each. For this exercise we will use a database of children's literature from the 19th century. \n",
