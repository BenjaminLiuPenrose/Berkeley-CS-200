    "* *Document Term Matrix*:\n",
    "    * a matrix that describes the frequency of terms that occur in a collection of documents. In a document-term matrix, rows correspond to documents in the collection and columns correspond to terms.\n",
    "* *TF-IDF Scores*: \n",
    "    * short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.\n",
    "* *Topic Modeling*:\n",
    "    * A general class of statistical models that uncover abstract topics within a text. It uses the co-occurrence of words within documents, compared to their distribution across documents, to uncover these abstract themes. The output is a list of weighted words, which indicate the subject of each topic, and a weight distribution across topics for each document.\n",

    "    * Latent Dirichlet Allocation. A particular model for topic modeling. It does not take document order into account, unlike other topic modeling algorithms."

    "How to find distinctive words in a corpus is a long-standing question in text analysis. Today, we'll learn one simple approach to this: TF-IDF. The idea behind words scores is to weight words not just by their frequency, but by their frequency in one document compared to their distribution across all documents. Words that are frequent, but are also used in every single document, will not be distinguising. We want to identify words that are unevenly distributed across the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular ways to weight words (beyond frequency counts) is `tf-idf score`. By offsetting the frequency of a word by its document frequency (the number of documents in which it appears) will in theory filter out common terms such as 'the', 'of', and 'and'.\n",

    "tfidf_word1 = (word1_frequency_document1 / word_count_document1) * (number_of_documents / number_document_with_word1)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate this manually, but scikit-learn has a built-in function to do so. This function also uses log frequencies, so the numbers will not correspond excactly to the calculations above. We'll use the [scikit-learn calculation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html), but a challenge for you: use Pandas to calculate this manually.

In the latter case, topic modeling a way to treat text as any data in a more tractable way for any subsequent statistical analysis (linear/logistic regression, etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many topic modeling algorithms, but we'll use LDA. This is a standard model to use. Again, the goal is not to learn everything you need to know about topic modeling. Instead, this will provide you some starter code to run a simple model, with the idea that you can use this base of knowledge to explore this further.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will run Latent Dirichlet Allocation, the most basic and the oldest version of topic modeling$^1$. We will run this in one big chunk of code. Our challenge: use our knowledge of scikit-learn that we gained above to walk through the code to understand what it is doing. Your challenge: figure out how to modify this code to work on your own data, and/or tweak the parameters to get better output.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a bit of theory. LDA is a generative model - a model over the entire data generating process - in which a document is a mixture of topics and topics are probability distributions over tokens in the vocabulary. The (normalized) frequency of word $j$ in document $i$ can be written as:\n",
    "$q_{ij} = v_{i1}*\\theta_{1j} + v_{i2}*\\theta_{2j} + ... + v_{iK}*\\theta_{Kj}$\n",
    "where K is the total number of topics, $\\theta_{kj}$ is the probability that word $j$ shows up in topic $k$ and $v_{ik}$ is the weight assigned to topic $k$ in document $i$. The model treats $v$ and $\\theta$ as generated from Dirichlet-distributed priors and can be estimated through Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we will be using a different dataset for this technique. The music reviews in the above dataset are often short, one word or one sentence reviews. Topic modeling is not really appropriate for texts that are this short. Instead, we want texts that are longer and are composed of multiple topics each. For this exercise we will use a database of children's literature from the 19th century. \n",
